Puzzle solving algorithm implementation using backtracking method in C.
User is supposed to enter a puzzle matrix.
For example: `[[1 2 3] [1 2 3] [1 2 3]]` is given matrix by user.
If each vertical number line is unique set, we have solved this puzzle.
Also, we can rotate only horizontally, within rows.
Possible solution is `[[1 2 3] [2 3 1] [3 2 1]]`.
This algorithm solves this kind of puzzle using backtracking.
If there is a solution, gives the solution. If not, indicates that there is no solution.
